**This project is part of **[**thehacker.recipes**](https://www.thehacker.recipes)** and is a work in progress**. I started it in 2021 and have absolutely no idea when this could be finished (will it ever be?).

The Hacker Tools is focused on documenting and giving tips & tricks on common infosec tools

This project is aimed at providing technical guides on various hacking tools.

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes.

:mega: Please feel free to contribute, give feedback/suggestions or reach out to me on Twitter ([@\_nwodtuhs](https://twitter.com/\_nwodtuhs)), Discord (Shutdown#2539), IRL or whatever you feel appropriate.

Almost every tool mentioned in theses notes is installed, and sometimes pre-configured, in [Exegol](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/Exegol), another project of mine of a docker environment ready to hack on day-to-day engagements. It's not much but I use it on all my engagements. Feel free to use it, to contribute, to give feedback etc.
