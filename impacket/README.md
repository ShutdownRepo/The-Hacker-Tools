# üõ†Ô∏è Impacket



## Setup

* **Requirements:**
  * [Python](http://www.python.org/) interpreter (version 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9).
  * [Third-party](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/requirements.txt) packages also needed.
* **Installing:**
  * Grab the latest stable release ([gzip‚Äôd tarbal](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases/download/impacket\_0\_9\_24/impacket-0.9.24.tar.gz)), unpack it and run: **** `python3 -m pip install .` (or `python2 -m pip install .` for Python 2.x) from the directory where you placed it. This will install the classes into the default Python modules path; note that you might need special permissions to write there.
* **Docker Support:**
  * Build Impacket‚Äôs image:  `docker build -t ‚Äúimpacket:latest‚Äù .`
  * Using Impacket‚Äôs image:  `docker run -it ‚Äìrm ‚Äúimpacket:latest‚Äù`

## Library Protocols

* [psexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/psexec.py) PSEXEC like functionality example using RemComSvc ([https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom)).
* [smbexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/smbexec.py) A similar approach to PSEXEC w/o using RemComSvc. The technique is described [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625065218/http://blog.accuvant.com/rdavisaccuvant/owning-computers-without-shell-access/). Our implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.
* [atexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/atexec.py) This example executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command.
* [wmiexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/wmiexec.py) A semi-interactive shell, used through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not require to install any service/agent at the target server. Runs as Administrator. Highly stealthy.
* [dcomexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/dcomexec.py) A semi-interactive shell similar to wmiexec.py, but using different DCOM endpoints. Currently supports MMC20.Application, ShellWindows and ShellBrowserWindow objects.
* [GetTGT.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/getTGT.py) Given a password, hash or aesKey, this script will request a TGT and save it as ccache.
* [GetST.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/getST.py) Given a password, hash, aesKey or TGT in ccache, this script will request a Service Ticket and save it as ccache. If the account has constrained delegation (with protocol transition) privileges you will be able to use the -impersonate switch to request the ticket on behalf another user.
* [GetPac.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/getPac.py) This script will get the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) structure of the specified target user just having a normal authenticated user credentials. It does so by using a mix of \[MS-SFU]‚Äôs S4USelf + User to User Kerberos Authentication.
* [GetUserSPNs.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) This example will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with JtR and HashCat.

Output is compatible with JtR.
* [raiseChild.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/raiseChild.py) This script implements a child-domain to forest privilege escalation by (ab)using the concept of Golden Tickets and ExtraSids.

* [ticketer.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/ticketer.py) This script will create Golden/Silver tickets from scratch or based on a template (legally requested from the KDC) allowing you to customize some of the parameters set inside the PAC\_LOGON\_INFO structure, in particular the groups, ExtraSids, duration, etc.
* [secretsdump.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/secretsdump.py) Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds) we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives in the target system (%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory) and read the rest of the data from there. For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials (if available) and Kerberos keys using the DL\_DRSGetNCChanges() method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available (e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled). After the work is done, things are restored to the original state.
* [mimikatz.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/mimikatz.py) Mini shell to control a remote mimikatz RPC server developed by @gentilkiwi.

The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed (e.g. create a user through LDAP) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. In this mode, for every connection relayed, it will be available to be used later on multiple times through a SOCKS proxy.

If the target system is enforcing signing and a machine account was provided, the module will try to gather the SMB session key through NETLOGON.
* [smbclient.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_24/examples/smbclient.py) A generic SMB client that will let you list shares and files, rename, upload and download files and create and delete directories, all using either username and password or username and hashes combination.
