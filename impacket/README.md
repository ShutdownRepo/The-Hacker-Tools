# üõ†Ô∏è Impacket

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g. SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.

Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.

## Script examples

### **Remote Execution**

* [psexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/psexec.py) PSEXEC like functionality example using RemComSvc ([https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom](https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom)).
* [smbexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/smbexec.py) A similar approach to PSEXEC w/o using RemComSvc. The technique is described [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625065218/http://blog.accuvant.com/rdavisaccuvant/owning-computers-without-shell-access/). Our implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.
* [atexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/atexec.py) This example executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command.
* [wmiexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/wmiexec.py) A semi-interactive shell, used through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not require to install any service/agent at the target server. Runs as Administrator. Highly stealthy.
* [dcomexec.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/dcomexec.py) A semi-interactive shell similar to wmiexec.py, but using different DCOM endpoints. Currently supports MMC20.Application, ShellWindows and ShellBrowserWindow objects.

### **Kerberos**

* [GetTGT.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/getTGT.py) Given a password, hash or aesKey, this script will request a TGT and save it as ccache.
* [GetST.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/getST.py) Given a password, hash, aesKey or TGT in ccache, this script will request a Service Ticket and save it as ccache. If the account has constrained delegation (with protocol transition) privileges you will be able to use the -impersonate switch to request the ticket on behalf another user.
* [GetPac.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/getPac.py) This script will get the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) structure of the specified target user just having a normal authenticated user credentials. It does so by using a mix of \[MS-SFU]‚Äôs S4USelf + User to User Kerberos Authentication.
* [GetUserSPNs.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) This example will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with JtR and HashCat.
* [GetNPUsers.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/GetNPUsers.py) This example will attempt to list and get TGTs for those users that have the property ‚ÄòDo not require Kerberos preauthentication‚Äô set (UF\_DONT\_REQUIRE\_PREAUTH). Output is compatible with JtR.
* [ticketConverter.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/ticketConverter.py): This script will convert kirbi files, commonly used by mimikatz, into ccache files used by Impacket, and vice versa.
* [ticketer.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/ticketer.py) This script will create Golden/Silver tickets from scratch or based on a template (legally requested from the KDC) allowing you to customize some of the parameters set inside the PAC\_LOGON\_INFO structure, in particular the groups, ExtraSids, duration, etc.
* [raiseChild.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/raiseChild.py) This script implements a child-domain to forest privilege escalation by (ab)using the concept of Golden Tickets and ExtraSids.

### **Windows Secrets**

* [secretsdump.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/secretsdump.py) Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds) we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives in the target system (%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory) and read the rest of the data from there. For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials (if available) and Kerberos keys using the DL\_DRSGetNCChanges() method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available (e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled). After the work is done, things are restored to the original state.
* [mimikatz.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/mimikatz.py) Mini shell to control a remote mimikatz RPC server developed by @gentilkiwi.

### **Server Tools/MiTM Attacks**

* [ntlmrelayx.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) This script performs NTLM Relay Attacks, setting an SMB and HTTP Server and relaying credentials to many different protocols (SMB, HTTP, MSSQL, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, etc.). The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed (e.g. create a user through LDAP) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. In this mode, for every connection relayed, it will be available to be used later on multiple times through a SOCKS proxy.
* [karmaSMB.py:](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/impacket\_0\_9\_23/examples/karmaSMB.py) A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified.
